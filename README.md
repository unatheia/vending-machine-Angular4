## Problem to solve >>>>
Implement the logic for a vending machine that will return the optimal change for a given number of pence.
This should be presented either a standalone function or class method.

Assume an unlimited supply of coins.
This method should return the least number of coins possible
The following denominations of coin are to be used
One pound = 100p; Fifty pence = 50p; Twenty pence = 20p; Ten pence = 10p; Five pence = 5p; Two pence = 2p; One penny = 1p
